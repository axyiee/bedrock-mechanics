# bedrock-mechanics

A client-side mod that add controller support and bedrock mechanics into Java Edition. The controller support should be
working on any controller by now.

This project is in the experimental phase, so don't expect the latest versions to have many features. Snapshots can be
tested through the artifacts generated by GitHub Actions.

Since the code is not version dependent, this mod should be able to run on all game versions supported by Fabric.
