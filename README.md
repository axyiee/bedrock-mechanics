# bedrock-mechanics

A mod for Fabric that ports Bedrock Edition mechanics to Java Edition. The controller support should be working on any
controller by now.

This project is in the experimental phase, so don't expect the latest versions to have many features. Snapshots can be
tested through the artifacts generated by GitHub Actions.

Since the code is not version dependent, this mod should be able to run on all game versions supported by Fabric.

> Want to help by submitting a bug report or a feature suggestion that should be ported to Java? I would appreciate it,
> you can use the issues tab for that. I can also answer any questions there or on Discord (nekkan#9515).
